## <a id="support-for-vs-code-editor"></a> Support for VS Code editor

> The combination of Windows 11 and WSL with Ubuntu Linux installed is a suitable combination for developing Laravel applications.

> This is how you can develop from [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) directly in Windows 11, including debugging on the fly with Xdebug in running Linux!

> In the VS Code editor, the project folder can be opened from a running Linux in the WSL environment.

> And it's completely free for commercial use too, which is great, thanks to Microsoft for what they've been able to change and offer to communities :smiley:
